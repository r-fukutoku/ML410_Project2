Create a new Github page with a presentation on the concepts of Locally Weighted Regression and Random Forest. 

Apply the regression methods to real data sets, such as "Cars" or "Boston Housing Data" where you consider only one input variable 
(the weight of the car for the "Cars" data set and the number of rooms for the "Boston Hausing" data). 
The output varable is the mileage for the "Cars" data set and "cmedv" or the median price for the housing data.

For each method and data set report the crossvalidated mean square error and determine which method is achieveng the better results.
In this paper you should also include theoretical considerations, examples of Python coding and plots. 
The final results should be clearly stated.

### Python code
```python
%matplotlib inline
%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/r-fukutoku/Project2/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/r-fukutoku/Project2/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
